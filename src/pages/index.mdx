## What is Cashu? {{ id: 'what-is-cashu' }}

Cashu is a new ecash protocol for custodial Bitcoin applications that is tightly integrated into the Lightning network. An Ecash system consists of two parts, the mint and the ecash wallet. Ecash transactions untraceable, instant, and require no fees. Cashu is built for Bitcoin. Wallets use the mint's Lightning node for making or receiving Bitcoin payments in exchange for ecash. A Cashu mint does not know who you are, what your balance is, or who you're transacting with. Users of a mint can exchange ecash privately without anyone being able to know who the involved parties are. Bitcoin payments are executed without anyone able to censor specific users. 

### Cryptography

Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on [David Wagner's variant](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) of Chaumian blinding (protocol specs).

### Protocol

Cashu [NUTs](https://github.com/cashubtc/nuts) (Notation, Usage, and Terminology) are Cashu's protocol specifications and the developer libraries make it easy to write wallets and mints. 

### Apps

There are multiple implementations of the Cashu protocol. Cashu is available as a command line interface (CLI) tool and as Progressive Web Apps (PWA) with a graphical user interface.
