  'An overview of Cashu compatible Mints and a basic guide to how to run your own Mint'

# What is a Cashu Mint?

Mints are Lightning node runners that have decided to let you use their Lightning infrastructure to offer you a service. They will act as a custodian for your satoshis on the Lightning network, while they issue ecash to you, the user. You can think of it as in free banking, where the bank issues their own bank notes that is backed by gold.

## Are Cashu Mints interoperable with each other (client diversity)?

Yes.

## DISCLAIMER

This is provided for educational purposes only. Many of the clients listed in this guide are still in active development and carry substantial risk. The authors advise the reader to be cautious, and first attempts at running a mint should be done on testnet/signet (not on mainnet Bitcoin) so that you can get to an understaning of the process. Do your own research and ask questions in the appropriate Telegram channel. Cashu is in its early development, you should use the protocol only with small amounts.


## General Observations

For all the mint clients that are at your disposal to install, in the majority of cases the most painless option is to follow the Docker installation process for that client. 

**What is Docker?**

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. The isolation and security lets you run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what's installed on the host. You can share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way. Read more here: https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview

## Platforms


### Linux

To complete any installation of a cashu mint on a Linux you will need the following technical proficiencies:
- knowledge of Bash / comfortable in a Terminal setting
- Root access to the machine that will be running the Mint
- Some knowledge of Lightning (node and channel management)

Covered in this guide are the following mainstream Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Debian, ...


----- Nutshell CLIENT ------

----- MOKSHA CLIENT ------

***Moksha***
moksha is a cashu library, mint and cli-wallet written in Rust.

#### Official Documentation
https://github.com/ngutech21/moksha/blob/master/README.md


### Installing Moksha using Docker

#### Docker-compose

docker-compose simplifies the process of running multi-container Docker applications. Here's how you can use it to run the moksha -mint:

1. First, you need to have Docker Compose installed on your machine. If it's not installed, you can download it from the [official Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2. Copy the tls.cert and admin.macaroon files from your LND instance into the `./data/mutinynet/` directory.

3. Configure the `LND_GRPC_HOST` environment variable in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point to your LND instance.

4. Run the following command in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file to start the mint and a postgres database:

```bash
docker-compose up -d app database
```

### Installing Moksha from Source (Ubuntu/Debian)

### Setup rust

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngutech21/moksha.git
cargo install just typos-cli sqlx-cli grcov wasm-pack wasm-opt
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cd moksha
```

### Install protobuf for your platform

This is needed for the LND backend.

```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
brew install protobuf
choco install protoc
```

### Config

```bash
mv .env.example .env
# edit .env file
vim .env
```

### Run mint (cashu-server)

To run the mint you need to setup a lightning regtest environment like [Polar](https://lightningpolar.com) and a Lnbits or Lnd instance. In Lnbits create a new wallet and copy the admin key into the .env file and set the url to your Lnbits instance. The mint uses PostgreSQL for storing used proofs and pending invoices. The database URL can be configured in the .env file.

```bash
install docker and docker-compose
docker compose up -d
just db-create
just run-mint
```

## Frequently Asked Questions about Mints


#### Can mints see my IP address?

Yes. Cashu doesn't protect against network-level heuristics per default. Users should take precautions to protect themselves against leaking network metadata by using privacy tools such as Tor.

#### Why can't I receive tokens from one mint into another mint?

Each mint has their own tokens. Therefore, you cannot receive tokens from one mint into another mint.
You can, however, use the tokens from one mint and swap them over Lightning for tokens from another mint. To transfer tokens from one mint to another, use the Multimint Swap functionality.

#### How do I send (swap) tokens from one mint to another?

In your wallet client UI, use the Multimint Swap functionality, which operates via Lightning invoices under the hood.

- Cashu.me: On the Settings tab.
- Nutstash: On the Mint tab.
- eNuts: Go to Options->Mint Management->Funds->Multimint Swap

Note: You must have 2 mints in order to send/swap between mints.

#### Is there a list of mints I can already connect to (mainnet)?

You can use Bitcoin Mints to list, review, and find mints: https://bitcoinmints.com/

Listed below are the default mints in some of the Cashu wallet clients:
- Cashu.me: https://8333.space:3338
- Minibits: https://mint.minibits.cash
- 

#### Can I send and receive tokens to/from the same mint?

Yes, this is a common first test use case. Also, sometimes you might send a token that is not received or redeemed, and you might want to copy the token and receive it back to yourself.

#### How can I run my own mint?

Read this guide, try it out and contact the developer if you have issues or wish to contribute to the projects.
